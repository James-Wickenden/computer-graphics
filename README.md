# A software rendering engine written from scratch in C++

Authors: Andy Page and James Wickenden

Includes a rasterizer and raytracer with the following capabilities:

- Lighting
- Hard Shadows
- Super-sampling anti-aliasing
- Perspective-corrected texture-mapping

NOTE: it is not hardware-accelerated, so it takes a long time to render.
(It currently produces a short animation.)
